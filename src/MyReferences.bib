abstract = {Recently, smart home products have shown signs of rapid development and increasing awareness of smart home platforms. In order to make smart home enterprises enter the era of Smart Home 2.0, it is necessary to consider the elements related to smart home platforms. This study examines the relationship between consumers’ value perception and the platform ecosystem theory and how this relationship contributes to their perception of smart home products’ value. This study aims to reveal the influence of smart home platform elements on the value perception of consumers regarding consumers’ perception of the smart home products’ value. To achieve this goal, an online survey (n = 595) was implemented to collect data from Japanese respondents. The analytical results presented in this study indicated that consumers, who sense the value of modularization of smart home products and inter-consumer connectivity, can sense the value of smart home products. In addition, consumers who can perceive the value of a platform service can indirectly feel the value of smart home products through modularity and inter-consumer connectivity. The results presented in this study provide new insights into product development in Smart Home 2.0.},

abstract = {Smart Home Personal Assistants (SPA) are an emerging innovation that is changing the means by which home users interact with technology. However, several elements expose these systems to various risks: (i) the open nature of the voice channel they use, (ii) the complexity of their architecture, (iii) the AI features they rely on, and (iv) their use of a wide range of underlying technologies. This article presents an in-depth review of SPA’s security and privacy issues, categorizing the most important attack vectors and their countermeasures. Based on this, we discuss open research challenges that can help steer the community to tackle and address current security and privacy issues in SPA. One of our key findings is that even though the attack surface of SPA is conspicuously broad and there has been a significant amount of recent research efforts in this area, research has so far focused on a small part of the attack surface, particularly on issues related to the interaction between the user and the SPA devices. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first article to conduct such a comprehensive review and characterization of the security and privacy issues and countermeasures of SPA.},
